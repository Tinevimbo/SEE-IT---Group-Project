								<h3 class="ttom">The Town of Marondera</h3>
							  <p>Marondera is the provincial capital of Mashonaland East province, Zimbabwe. The continuously growing town draws its strength from its surronding successful farms, its proximity to Harare, and its strategic location along the Mutare road and the Harare-Beira railway. The town is home to some of the best schools in the country, among them Peterhouse, Bernard Mizeki, Godfrey Huggins and Kushinga Phikelela Polytechnic, to name a few. It also hosts a fair share of places of recreational and entertainment.
